# Research


My research interests currently lie in understanding substance use disorders and mental illnesses. I have presented my work at a variety of science competitions, and my work has been published in in various venues as well.


## Predicting and Understanding Opioid Use Disorder

This project uses a variety of machine learning techniques to predict adults at risk for developing opioid use disorder.
